# Types of Fiber Optics

Fiber optic cables are categorized into three main types, each optimized for different performance needs based on bandwidth, distance, and application.

---

## 🔹 1. Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)

- **Core Size**: ~8–10 µm  
- **Wavelengths**: 1310 nm and 1550 nm  
- **Transmission Distance**: Up to 40–100+ km (with amplification)  
- **Bandwidth**: Very high  
- **Light Source**: Laser (narrow beam)

### ✔️ Ideal for:
- Long-distance telecommunications
- Metro and backbone networks
- Submarine cables
- Data center interconnects

### Pros:
- Minimal signal attenuation
- Highest transmission speeds
- Excellent for long-haul communication

### Cons:
- Higher cost (transceivers and installation)
- Precise alignment needed due to narrow core

## 🔹 2. Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)

- **Core Size**: 50 µm or 62.5 µm  
- **Wavelengths**: 850 nm and 1300 nm  
- **Transmission Distance**: Up to 550–2,000 meters (depends on speed)  
- **Bandwidth**: Lower than SMF  
- **Light Source**: LED or VCSEL

### ✔️ Ideal for:
- Local Area Networks (LAN)
- Short-distance links in data centers
- Building interconnections

### Pros:
- Lower cost and easier installation
- Larger core simplifies connector alignment

### Cons:
- More modal dispersion
- Not suitable for long-distance use

## 🔹 3. Plastic Optical Fiber (POF)

- **Core Size**: ~1 mm  
- **Material**: Plastic (e.g., PMMA)  
- **Distance**: Less than 100 meters  
- **Bandwidth**: Very low  
- **Light Source**: LED

### ✔️ Ideal for:
- Consumer electronics (e.g., home audio)
- Industrial control systems
- Automotive (e.g., MOST bus)

### Pros:
- Inexpensive and flexible
- Easy to handle and install

### Cons:
- High attenuation
- Limited data rate and distance
