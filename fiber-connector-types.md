## ðŸ”¹ LC (Lucent Connector)

- **Ferrule Size**: 1.25 mm
- **Connector Type**: Push-pull latch
- **Use Cases**:
  - High-density data centers
  - Network switches, transceivers (SFP/SFP+)
- **Advantages**:
  - Compact size
  - Common in modern high-speed equipment
- **Notes**:
  - Often used with UPC or APC polish for low reflection

## ðŸ”¹ SC (Subscriber Connector)

- **Ferrule Size**: 2.5 mm
- **Connector Type**: Push-pull snap
- **Use Cases**:
  - Older enterprise and telecom networks
  - Media converters, fiber modems
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple and rugged design
  - Widely adopted in the 1990sâ€“2000s
- **Notes**:
  - Still found in many legacy installations

## ðŸ”¹ ST (Straight Tip Connector)

- **Ferrule Size**: 2.5 mm
- **Connector Type**: Bayonet-style twist-lock
- **Use Cases**:
  - Multimode networks in military, education
  - Legacy campus fiber installations
- **Advantages**:
  - Secure connection under vibration
- **Notes**:
  - Being phased out in favor of LC and SC

## ðŸ”¹ MTP/MPO (Multi-Fiber Push-On)

- **Fibers**: 8, 12, 24, or more in a single connector
- **Connector Type**: Push-on
- **Use Cases**:
  - High-speed backbone links (40G/100G/400G)
  - Spine-leaf and top-of-rack switches
- **Advantages**:
  - Supports parallel optics and high-density deployments
- **Notes**:
  - Requires precision alignment and proper cleaning

## ðŸ”¹ FC (Ferrule Connector)

- **Ferrule Size**: 2.5 mm
- **Connector Type**: Threaded screw-on
- **Use Cases**:
  - Lab test environments
  - Precision industrial and telecom setups
- **Advantages**:
  - Excellent stability under vibration
- **Notes**:
  - Less common in modern networks, but great in labs
