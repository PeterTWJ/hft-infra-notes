# Rack and Stack Process

## 1. Pre-Rack Preparation
- **Verify equipment:** Confirm all servers, rails, cables, PDUs, switches, cage nuts, screws, and tools are present.
- **Review rack layout:** Double-check against the floor plan/rack elevation diagram.
- **Label assets:** Apply asset tags and labels per company policy.
- **Check power/cooling:** Ensure adequate power and cooling in the rack space.

## 2. Physical Rack and Stack
- **Install rails:** Attach server rails at correct U positions as per rack diagram.
- **Heavy equipment first:** Place heaviest gear (UPS, storage, large servers) at the bottom.
- **Mount equipment:** Slide servers/switches into rails and secure with screws.
- **Cable management:** Route cables neatly along the sides/back; use Velcro or cable ties.
- **Install PDUs:** Attach PDUs as required (vertical or horizontal).
- **Label cables:** Label both ends of every cable.

## 3. Power-up and Initial Check
- **Verify connections:** Double-check power, network, and management ports.
- **Power up sequentially:** Turn on devices one at a time to avoid current spikes.
- **Check status LEDs:** Look for hardware errors or boot issues.
- **Network verification:** Use crash cart or remote management (iLO/iDRAC/IPMI) to confirm network link.

## 4. Documentation
- **Inventory update:** Record serial numbers, rack/U position, and MAC addresses.
- **Cable map:** Document all network and power connections.
- **Photographic record:** Take “as-installed” photos for reference.

## 5. Handover for Provisioning
- **Tag for PXE:** Mark servers for PXE boot if needed.
- **Notify stakeholders:** Inform sysadmin or network team that hardware is ready.

## Pro Tips
- Use a torque driver to avoid stripping screws.
- Leave room for airflow and future expansion.
- Don’t block access to PDUs.
- Keep crash cart, ESD strap, flashlight, and spare hardware nearby.
