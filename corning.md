## 🛠️ 1. Corning EXACT/EDGE Pre-Terminated Fiber Cabling

**Used in**: Co-location facilities, data center interconnects

- **Product Lines**: 
  - Corning EDGE™ and EDGE8® solutions
  - Pre-terminated and length-optimized cabling
  - High-density patch panels and modules

**Key Benefits**:
- Controlled fiber lengths for **latency determinism**
- Plug-and-play deployment for fast installation
- Designed for environments with tight compliance on fiber length (e.g., Deutsche Börse, NYSE)

## 🌫️ 2. Hollow-Core Fiber (Next-Gen Optics)

**Used in**: Low-latency backhaul between trading venues

- Corning is involved in developing and commercializing hollow-core fiber.
- Some HFT firms already deploy hollow-core from third-party vendors (e.g., Lumenisity, OFS).

**Key Benefits**:
- Up to 30% lower latency than traditional glass fiber
- Minimal chromatic dispersion
- Ideal for long-haul low-latency routes (e.g., between NY and Chicago)

## 🔄 3. ClearCurve® and Specialty Optical Fibers

**Used in**: In-rack and intra-building optical routing

- **ClearCurve** fiber provides high flexibility and bend resistance
- Enables compact routing without performance loss

**Key Benefits**:
- Simplifies rack and panel installations
- Maintains performance even under tight bends
