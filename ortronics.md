# Ortronics Products Used in High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

## Overview
High-Frequency Trading (HFT) environments demand ultra-low latency, high bandwidth, and highly reliable network infrastructure. To meet these demands, infrastructure components must support optimal signal integrity and minimal latency across data paths.

## Recommended Ortronics Product

### Infinium Quantum Fiber System

**Manufacturer:** Ortronics (by Legrand)  
**Product Type:** High-performance fiber optic cabling system  
**Primary Use Case:** Ultra-low loss fiber infrastructure for latency-sensitive environments such as HFT

#### Key Features:
- **Ultra-low insertion loss:** Total channel loss as low as 0.75 dB
- **High return loss:** Optimized for signal clarity and minimal degradation
- **Direct connections:** Reduces connection points and potential signal reflections
- **Modular design:** Supports flexible deployment in scalable HFT environments
- **Standards compliance:** Exceeds TIA and ISO performance standards

#### Benefits for HFT:
- Minimizes signal degradation across links
- Reduces transmission delay with lower latency cabling
- Improves overall system uptime and throughput
- Enables faster and more reliable order execution

## Why It Matters
In HFT, even nanoseconds of delay can impact competitiveness. The Infinium Quantum system's low loss and precision-engineered components contribute to deterministic, high-speed performance across trading floors and colocated data centers.

## Additional Notes
While specific vendor-product relationships in HFT are rarely disclosed publicly, the Infinium Quantum system's specs and target use cases strongly align with the needs of firms operating in low-latency financial environments.
