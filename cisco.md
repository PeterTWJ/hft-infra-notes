## ‚ö° Nexus Ultra-Low Latency (ULL) Switches

### Nexus 3548
- Features **Algo Boost** technology
- Sub-200‚ÄØns Layer 2 forwarding latency
- Layer 3 latency around 250‚ÄØns
- Widely adopted in HFT for deterministic performance

### Nexus 3550 (FPGA-powered)
- Incorporates **Exablaze** technology
- Enhanced multicast fairness
- Nanosecond-precision hardware timestamping
- Suitable for HFT edge and aggregation layers
