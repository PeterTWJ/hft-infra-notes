## 🔌 Connector Performance Table

| Connector   | Ferrule Size | Typical Insertion Loss | Return Loss (Reflection) | Vibration Stability | Latency Impact | Use Case Notes                                |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **LC**      | 1.25 mm      | ~0.1–0.3 dB             | >45 dB                    | Good                 | Very Low       | Ideal for data centers and low-jitter systems |
| **SC**      | 2.5 mm       | ~0.2–0.5 dB             | >40 dB                    | Good                 | Low            | Common in enterprise and telecom networks     |
| **ST**      | 2.5 mm       | ~0.2–0.5 dB             | ~30–40 dB                 | Moderate             | Low–Moderate   | Used in legacy networks                       |
| **FC**      | 2.5 mm       | ~0.2–0.3 dB             | >45 dB                    | Excellent            | Very Low       | Great for labs and high-vibration setups      |
| **MTP/MPO** | Multi-fiber  | ~0.3–0.7 dB             | >30–40 dB                 | Fair–Good            | Moderate       | High-density links; requires precise alignment|

## 🧪 Key Terms

- **Insertion Loss (dB)**: Signal loss due to the connector. Lower is better.
- **Return Loss (dB)**: Signal reflected back toward the source. Higher is better.
- **Latency Impact**: Real-world delay effects due to reflection, jitter, or instability.
- **Polish Types**:
  - **UPC** (Ultra Physical Contact): ~-50 dB return loss (common).
  - **APC** (Angled Physical Contact): ~-60 dB return loss (best for HFT/RF).

## 🏁 HFT / Low-Jitter Recommendations

| Use Case                            | Recommended Connector | Polish | Reason                                         |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| **High-frequency trading (HFT)**    | LC or FC               | APC    | Minimal reflection and excellent stability     |
| **40G/100G/400G high-density links**| MTP/MPO                | UPC    | Compact, scalable, needs perfect alignment     |
| **Legacy or general enterprise**    | SC or ST               | UPC    | Still usable, but less optimal for precision   |

> For optimal performance in latency-sensitive networks, use **APC-polished LC or FC connectors** with tight cleaning and alignment discipline.
