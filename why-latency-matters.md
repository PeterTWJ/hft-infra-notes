# Why Latency Matters in HFT

**Latency** is the time delay between when a trading command is sent and when it is executed. In High-Frequency Trading (HFT), minimizing latency is crucial for several reasons:

## 1. First-Mover Advantage
- The fastest trader wins the best prices and profits from fleeting opportunities.
- If you’re slower, you might miss out or get a worse price.

## 2. Rapid Price Changes
- Markets move in microseconds.
- Delays can turn profitable trades into losses.

## 3. Intense Competition
- HFT is a speed race—every microsecond counts.
- Lower latency means more successful trades.

## 4. Reduced Adverse Selection
- Fast updates help avoid being on the wrong side of sudden price moves.

## 5. Safer Market Making
- Quicker order updates reduce risk when providing liquidity.

**In summary:**  
Lower latency in HFT means more opportunities, higher profits, and lower risk. Speed isn’t just an advantage—it’s essential.
